# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures - Certification Projects

This repository contains the certification projects completed as part of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course from FreeCodeCamp. These projects are a key component in earning the course certification and showcase my proficiency in JavaScript and data structures.

## Description

The "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course covers fundamental JavaScript topics, data structures, algorithms, and advanced concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, and asynchronous data handling. The following projects are part of the process to earn certification in this course.

### Objective

The goal of this repository is to showcase the certification projects I have completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp course. Each project reflects a skill learned and applied through building a specific application.

## Certification Projects

### 1. **Palindrome Checker**
   In this project, I built an application that checks whether a word or phrase is a palindrome. It involves string manipulation and character comparison.

   - **Technologies**: JavaScript
   - **Description**: The application takes an input string and checks if it reads the same forward and backward.

### 2. **Roman Numeral Converter**
   This project involves converting an integer into its Roman numeral equivalent. It tests algorithmic thinking and number manipulation.

   - **Technologies**: JavaScript
   - **Description**: The application takes an integer and converts it into Roman numerals.

### 3. **Telephone Number Validator**
   In this project, I built an application that validates whether a United States phone number is in the correct format.

   - **Technologies**: JavaScript
   - **Description**: The application checks if the phone number follows the correct format (including area code, etc.).

### 4. **Cash Register**
   This project involves creating a cash register application that returns the correct change.

   - **Technologies**: JavaScript
   - **Description**: The application takes a payment amount and returns the change in the most efficient way possible, using available denominations.

### 5. **Pokémon Search App**
   The goal of this project is to build an app that allows users to search for information about Pokémon using an API.

   - **Technologies**: JavaScript, API Fetch
   - **Description**: The application fetches data from a Pokémon API and displays search results.
